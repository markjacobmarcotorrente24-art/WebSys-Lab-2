          <h2 class="entry-title">FINISHING UP</h2>
          <p class="entry-content">
            After 4 days of non-stop work, the blog website was finally
            finished. It was really tough project to work on since from the
            beginning, I've already set the bar too high for the both of use. Im
            just glad that the project was finished on time (or so I thought).
            The hard was making sure the CSS and JS files would work even after
            pushing in the repository. It was the problem that also took hours
            troubleshooting. Also learning the push and pull in Git was also
            painstakingly hard though I can say that I've learned most of the
            stuff. I cant promise that I mastered it though.
            <br />
            <br />
            Planning and implementing was really fun, although we really skipped
            most coding parts because learning Git took most of our time, I'd
            say that the project was successful and the same as we envisioned. I
            also am really thankful to my project partner, Xian, both of us
            worked our ass off for this project. This might be the last entry,
            kinda bittersweet for a project that took most of our time hahaha, a
            feeling of accomplishment and melancholy since its over.

          <p class="entry-content">
            I have a feeling that the project might be finished today. The only
            things that can delay it at this point would be Github or my
            laziness. Making a new repository and pushing new files almost took
            a whole day which was a hassle. So far the only missing page is the
            landing page or "index.html" because of a design flaw last time. We
            have talked about it and now planning to implement it some time
            later. I just hope that its the last thing we need to worry.

            Repository in Github is becoming a real issue. I dont know why but
            the laptop can't just find the repository made for the project. I've
            talked about it with Xian. Later I'll make a new repository. Surely
            this will work now right? Right?

            We've finally finished doing the design for the portfolio and blog
            pages, though I insisted that we started doing it rather than
            designing the landing page. So we started designing it, also asked
            from a friend on how to use Git because I didn't get it the first
            time. I'll probably work on it later as long as I get home at 10pm
            the earliest.

            Just finished talking with Xian about project specifics. I've done
            it again, although the design was more simple than my other works,
            still using javascript will be a pain in the ass, I can tell. Will
            start project maybe later after dinner or one round of Valorant
            competetive, depends on when Xian is online.
