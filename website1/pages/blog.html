          <h2 class="entry-title">FINISHING UP</h2>
          <p class="entry-content">
            After 4 days of non-stop work, the blog website was finally
            finished. It was really tough project to work on since from the
            beginning, I've already set the bar too high for the both of use. Im
            just glad that the project was finished on time (or so I thought).
            The hard was making sure the CSS and JS files would work even after
            pushing in the repository. It was the problem that also took hours
            troubleshooting. Also learning the push and pull in Git was also
            painstakingly hard though I can say that I've learned most of the
            stuff. I cant promise that I mastered it though.
            <br />
            <br />
            Planning and implementing was really fun, although we really skipped
            most coding parts because learning Git took most of our time, I'd
            say that the project was successful and the same as we envisioned. I
            also am really thankful to my project partner, Xian, both of us
            worked our ass off for this project. This might be the last entry,
            kinda bittersweet for a project that took most of our time hahaha, a
            feeling of accomplishment and melancholy since its over.

          <p class="entry-content">
              After four days of grinding almost non-stop, our blog website is finally finished. 
               What started as a simple idea slowly turned into something much bigger than we expected. 
               im thankful for my project partner, Jacob, for working hard on this project with me.
               We really had to push ourselves to learn Git and GitHub, which was a huge part of the project.
               And im sure were still not even close to mastering it, but we did learn a little 
               and we were able to implement it in our project.
                The project was really fun to work on, and im really proud of what we were able to accomplish.
                 Although it was really stressful at times, it was all worth it in the end. 
                 This might be the last entry for this project, and im really happy with how it turned out.
                 that's it for now, GG!

          <p class="entry-content">
            I have a feeling that the project might be finished today. The only
            things that can delay it at this point would be Github or my
            laziness. Making a new repository and pushing new files almost took
            a whole day which was a hassle. So far the only missing page is the
            landing page or "index.html" because of a design flaw last time. We
            have talked about it and now planning to implement it some time
            later. I just hope that its the last thing we need to worry.

            talked about it with Xian. Later I'll make a new repository. Surely

            We've finally finished doing the design for the portfolio and blog
            pages, though I insisted that we started doing it rather than
            designing the landing page. So we started designing it, also asked
            from a friend on how to use Git because I didn't get it the first
            time. I'll probably work on it later as long as I get home at 10pm
            the earliest.

            still using javascript will be a pain in the ass, I can tell. Will
            start project maybe later after dinner or one round of Valorant
            competetive, depends on when Xian is online.

                                    For now, we’ve got the structure in mind and a clear plan moving forward. 
                                    Execution starts soon… unless someone asks us to queue Valorant first.
